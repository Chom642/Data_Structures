## Documentation of Individual Achievements
The main feature of our website is the calender, which allows our sponsor, Mr. Mortensen, to log in and create events on the calender that future/current CSA and CSP students. These events can be expanded when clicked on in the calender, and can be updated, or deleted after the creation of the event. Throughout the tri, because I was the design manager, I worked mostly on CSS and making sure that the website's theme matched what our sponser wanted, as well as that the CSS on each page functioned properly. I also worked on the active date and time of calender. I think I could've done more and worked more in class so im giving myself a 3.75/5, however I think that overall the team worked very hard so I would give the team 4.5/5

## Things I learned
I learned a lot about work ethics throughout the tri. At the start of the tri I was a little bit less focused than I would've like to be after AP testing. So I had to find ways to keep myself focused. Additionally I had to find ways to keep myself engaged and motivated after AP testing because after AP tests my work load decreased significantly, so I tended to put work off. But in accordance to technicals and such, I also learned how to  integrate and use crud via the calender, as welll as how to make a calender that has an automatic date system.
