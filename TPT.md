Week 0 (TPT 5.1 - 5.2)

5.1:
-

-Internet can have both positive and negative effects on people.
Internet Benefits: Faster and easier communication, collboration  etc. Speeds up the process of learning/finding information. Entertainment is much more accessable
ex: Social media or Google.

-Internet problems: Can be a sourcce of addiction, malware and ransomeware (viruses), and well as privacy issues for users
ex: Trojan horse viruses, or databases, while they could be good, they could also be hacked leaking personal information.

5.2
-

-Not everybody has access to the internet. This is calle internet divide.

-This is due to geographical or financial differences.

-Digital divide should be considered when creating certain programs etc.


How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
-Somebody can empower themself in the digital world by learning how to use technology effectively
How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
-Somebody empowered can help another person by teaching them about technology and how to effectively use technology. Something I could do would be to help others understand how to effectively use technology, especially those who are not well versed in using tech.
Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
-Red tape blocks digital empowerment because it stops users from reaching certain sites and expanding their understanding of technology. I believe that there are such barriers at del norte, like when certain websites are blocked. This is also especially evident in China where many things are blocked/censored.


5.3:
-

-Programs occasionally exclude certain groups of people

-Types of computing bias: preexisting, technical, emergent:

Preexisting: roots in social institutions, attitudes, practices (male vs female, rich vs poor)
Technical: technical consideration and constraints (equipment to work with or resources)
Emergent: Arises in context of use (One company has better resources or applications than another)

5.4
-

-Get information and shared information from others through programing
Example being Wikipedia, APIs, Cryptocurrency, etc.

-Crowdsourcing helps when resources are limited or required data/viewpoints are needed

Actions:
5.3
-
-I don't think that this was intentional, I think maybe because he may not have had a big enough or diverse enough sample to choose from

-I don't think that this is harmful or intended to be, it was just a mistake from the programmer

-I think that it should be corrected, and one way I would correct this would to just get a bigger more diverse sample size to ensure that the program functions as intended

5.4
-

-One way that crowdsourcing could be used, would be to create a website where students can submit their code, then other students can give advice to their code.

-DNHS crowdsourcing can't help our website by allowing other students to give our website feedback, or to allow students to answer specific questions on the content

5.5
-

-Groups and companies use different licenses when they public work

-For example, Linux has open source code that can be used by the public for free

-Qualcomm puts patents on their work, which makes them money, wheras linux is free to use.

-Sources must always be cited.

5.6
-

-Personal information is everywhere on the internet

-2-Factor authentication is a good way of staying safer on the internet, against things like malware and phishing

-Encryption also keeps ur data off the web.

Actions
-
5.5
-
-If I wanted to make money from my projects I would use something like the MIT open source liscence, however on the other hand if I just wanted to make my project eavailable to everybody, I would use something like a GPL.

-The liscence I chose for my personal GitHub page is GNU GPLv3, because its educational and I want people to be able to access the information for free. Additionally people will be able to add on to my project if they want too. Our group also decided to use is GPL
5.6
-
-PII we have inside of our project would be is our names, school, and contact info.

-I am not exposed, I do not have any bad PII on the internet that is accessable to the public

-A good password would be lengthy, and contain special symbols and/or numbers. While a bad password would be short and easy to guess.

-Symmetric encryption only uses a single key, which is faster however less secure. Asymmetric encryption is more modern and uses two keys.

-When we deploy we encode private information about the user and machine on which the project is being deployed onto. For example IP addresses are used in the deployment process.

-When I was younger I would see ads, scams, and other phishing attempts on the internet, however I never fell for any of them personally.
