Week 0 (TPT 5.1 - 5.2)

5.1:
-

-Internet can have both positive and negative effects on people.
Internet Benefits: Faster and easier communication, collboration  etc. Speeds up the process of learning/finding information. Entertainment is much more accessable
ex: Social media or Google.

-Internet problems: Can be a sourcce of addiction, malware and ransomeware (viruses), and well as privacy issues for users
ex: Trojan horse viruses, or databases, while they could be good, they could also be hacked leaking personal information.

5.2
-

-Not everybody has access to the internet. This is calle internet divide.

-This is due to geographical or financial differences.

-Digital divide should be considered when creating certain programs etc.


How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
-Somebody can empower themself in the digital world by learning how to use technology effectively
How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
-Somebody empowered can help another person by teaching them about technology and how to effectively use technology. Something I could do would be to help others understand how to effectively use technology, especially those who are not well versed in using tech.
Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
-Red tape blocks digital empowerment because it stops users from reaching certain sites and expanding their understanding of technology. I believe that there are such barriers at del norte, like when certain websites are blocked. This is also especially evident in China where many things are blocked/censored.


5.3:
-

-Programs occasionally exclude certain groups of people

-Types of computing bias: preexisting, technical, emergent:

Preexisting: roots in social institutions, attitudes, practices (male vs female, rich vs poor)
Technical: technical consideration and constraints (equipment to work with or resources)
Emergent: Arises in context of use (One company has better resources or applications than another)

5.4
-

-Get information and shared information from others through programing
Example being Wikipedia, APIs, Cryptocurrency, etc.

-Crowdsourcing helps when resources are limited or required data/viewpoints are needed

Actions:
5.3
-
-I don't think that this was intentional, I think maybe because he may not have had a big enough or diverse enough sample to choose from
ADDING ON: I also think that this wasn't very intentional, and it probably opens up the idea that the company needs to account for the diversity of the people using their product. This could be achieved by having people from different races, rather than all from the same race .

-I don't think that this is harmful or intended to be, it was just a mistake from the programmer

-I think that it should be corrected, and one way I would correct this would to just get a bigger more diverse sample size to ensure that the program functions as intended

5.4
-

-One way that crowdsourcing could be used, would be to create a website where students can submit their code, then other students can give advice to their code.

-DNHS crowdsourcing can't help our website by allowing other students to give our website feedback, or to allow students to answer specific questions on the content

5.5
-

-Groups and companies use different licenses when they public work

-For example, Linux has open source code that can be used by the public for free

-Qualcomm puts patents on their work, which makes them money, wheras linux is free to use.

-Sources must always be cited.

5.6
-

-Personal information is everywhere on the internet

-2-Factor authentication is a good way of staying safer on the internet, against things like malware and phishing

-Encryption also keeps ur data off the web.

Actions
-
5.5
-
-If I wanted to make money from my projects I would use something like the MIT open source liscence, however on the other hand if I just wanted to make my project eavailable to everybody, I would use something like a GPL.

-The liscence I chose for my personal GitHub page is GNU GPLv3, because its educational and I want people to be able to access the information for free. Additionally people will be able to add on to my project if they want too. Our group also decided to use is GPL
5.6
-
-PII we have inside of our project would be is our names, school, and contact info.

-I am not exposed, I do not have any bad PII on the internet that is accessable to the public

-A good password would be lengthy, and contain special symbols and/or numbers. While a bad password would be short and easy to guess.

-Symmetric encryption only uses a single key, which is faster however less secure. Asymmetric encryption is more modern and uses two keys.

-When we deploy we encode private information about the user and machine on which the project is being deployed onto. For example IP addresses are used in the deployment process.

-When I was younger I would see ads, scams, and other phishing attempts on the internet, however I never fell for any of them personally.


## Finals Quiz 1 -- 45/50
- Question 9
  - I misread the chart and thought that the automated system would route the customer to a human rep
- Question 23
  - I thought that the ip address would be more damaging, however it doesn't contain information about the user
- Question 24
  - I forgot about how internet protocals worked, and that the meta data is where to send the data not how to catagorize
- Question 28
  - Data thats compressed cannot be restored, however there are still tradeoffs for using it/positives
- Question 32
   - Not moving line 5 to be between line 2 and 3 would change the input and have an unintended output.
- Question 42
   - I converted my binary wrong by accident

## Finals Quiz 2 -- 41/50
- Question 7
   - Lossless compression allows the data to be uncompressed, not secured
- Question 8
   - Open-source software just allows developers to customize the source code to suit their individual needs
- Question 16
   - Radio songs are arguably more biased than just selecting/gathering data from random users
- Question 22
   - IVP6 isn't shorter than IVP4 addressed, it just allows a greater number of addresses to connect
- Question 24
   - Redundancy only allows packages to be transmitted along multiple paths, not to submit less packages
- Question 35
   - Integers cannot be subject to rounding errors because they aren't fractions and hence cannot be rounded
- Question 43
   - I miss counted the code, the robot would end up in the bottom right corner
- Question 45
   - The program would not identify students with a grade point average less than 3.5
- Question 50
   - All three datapoints could be obtained from the table 


## Finals Quiz 3 -- 43/50
- Question 6
   - Marked it wrong, but said it was correct
- Question 9
   - The flowchart doesn't explicity state that it needed both the floor > 10 and the bedrooms = 3, but it was either or
- Question 13
   - The code would incorrectly charge people who use more than 25 units of electricity, instead it was would be C.
- Question 17
   - One of my answers was wrong, the procedure would return with the correct value of 10, it should have been C
- Question 21
   - Overwhelming the system, wouldn't change no matter the password strenght
- Question 30
   - Internet is the network of interconnected networks, WWW is just an information system accessed by the internet
- Question 45
   - Misread frequent and infrequent.
