How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
-Somebody can empower themself in the digital world by learning how to use technology effectively
How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
-Somebody empowered can help another person by teaching them about technology and how to effectively use technology. Something I could do would be to help others understand how to effectively use technology, especially those who are not well versed in using tech.
Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
-Red tape blocks digital empowerment because it stops users from reaching certain sites and expanding their understanding of technology. I believe that there are such barriers at del norte, like when certain websites are blocked. This is also especially evident in China where many things are blocked/censored.
